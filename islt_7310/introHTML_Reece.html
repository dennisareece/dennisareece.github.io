     Hello my name is Dennis Reece and I currently live outside of Nashville, Tennessee. I received my Master’s in Education in Curriculum Design and Learning and Development from Concordia University. I have work at UnitedHealthcare since September 2013, working as a trainer and instructional designer. Currently I work for the Community and State division of Long-Term Services and Supports as an instructional designer. I have over 15 years’ experience as an instructional designer and 20 years’ experience as a trainer. I began my corporate career helping two startup companies in Minneapolis in the 1990’s, where I developed the training and consulting divisions. I specialize in applying my expertise with training/design knowledge to all my training solutions, online, virtual instructor lead and standalone instructional materials. In my spare time I like to keep physically fit by working out daily and participating in other sports. For relaxation I love taking cruises. I try to give back to the community and am involved in numerous charity events. Grateful for an amazing group of friends and family I make sure people are welcomed in a heartwarming way.
     I would like to learn as much as I can about web design from this class so that I can utilize the information and weave it into my instructional packages.
