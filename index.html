    <h1>Dennis Reece</h1>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>I selected this type of website as it would align with my skill set to help others learn more about myself and background. This site will assist in showcasing my strengths and allow others to interact with me on a professional basis.
    <h2>Introduction</h2>    
        <p>My professional web site can be updated at any time and provide a platform for me to acquire new skills. Having control over what information I share is a powerful web tool. This professional web site provides an advantage over others that do not have a tool to share information about themselves quickly and professionally. </p>
