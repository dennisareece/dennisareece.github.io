As I reflect on my experience as an instructional designer and the many lessons I have learned about course design, I recognize many elements of instructional design theories in my work. First, before I began building a course, I reacquainted myself with popular learning theories to determine my personal thoughts on what learning is and how it takes place. Through this reflection I identify myself as cognitivist and constructivist through a key opinion I hold as an instructional designer: learners are actively involved in their learning and develop their own context for learning. By identifying my belief on how individuals learn I am able to begin a vision for the course; I want a course that allows learners the flexibility to learn the way they want and I want to provide authentic assignments to bring relevance to the real world.

  <h2>Instructional Design Reflection</h2> 
    
    
   <ul>
            <li>Knowledge: Instructional Design</li>
   </ul>    
  
<div>    
<p>
    
I refer to instructional design models to begin to determine the process I will take to organize and deliver a blended learning course. I am struck by the similarities between different learning models: most models include analyzing, designing/developing, implementing, and evaluating. These procedures are identified in the ADDIE model, so, I use this design model in building all my courses. I find it to be easy to use, straight-forward, and most importantly, practical. One particular part I like is how it accounts for evaluation throughout the entire process. As I develop a course I continually evaluated every decision I was make, from the resources I use, to organize, and assess.

<p>  
    
Another crucial element in my course design is to develop a plan. Using a plan format begins by identifying the learning objectives before determining how they will be tested and finally what activities will support mastery of the learning objectives. Using a format planning tool creates a solid foundation for which to design and implement a digital learning environment.
    
</p>
    
<p>    
    
As I begin to reflect on courses Iâ€™ve created and the experiences it has afforded me, I realize a great course is never truly finished.  This idea incorporates digital learning to include face-to-face teaching as well. Continual evaluation, redevelopment, and implementation are keys to achieving optimum learning outcomes by the learner. As I move forward as an instructional designer I will take lessons learned with me. I will continue to evaluate and tweak courses I develop and tailor them to each audience in order to provide learners with the best possible courses and learning environment.
